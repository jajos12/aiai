## 1. Platform Architecture & Tech Stack

### Option A: Next.js Full-Stack Monolith

```
Next.js App Router → React pages → Canvas/D3 visualizations
API routes for any backend needs
Deploy: Vercel (frontend) + Render (backend API if needed)
```

| ✅ Pros                                               | ❌ Cons                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| SSR/SSG for fast loads & SEO                          | Heavier framework, more boilerplate          |
| File-based routing = easy content organization        | Overkill if we're mostly static visual pages |
| Built-in API routes                                   | Tight coupling if we split backend later     |
| Huge ecosystem, easy Vercel deploy                    |                                              |
| React component model perfect for interactive widgets |                                              |

### Option B: Vite + React SPA

```
Vite + React → Client-side SPA
Separate FastAPI/Express backend (later)
Deploy: Vercel/Netlify (frontend) + Render (backend)
```

| ✅ Pros                         | ❌ Cons                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Blazing fast dev experience     | No SSR out of the box (worse SEO initially) |
| Lightweight, minimal config     | Need separate routing setup                 |
| Easy to eject or restructure    | No built-in API routes                      |
| Very familiar if you know React |                                             |

### Option C: Astro + React Islands

```
Astro static site → React "islands" for interactive visualizations
Content in MDX files → Static generation
```

| ✅ Pros                                                 | ❌ Cons                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Ships zero JS by default, islands only load when needed | Less mature ecosystem for complex SPAs |
| MDX-native = perfect for content + embedded components  | Harder to share state between islands  |
| Blazing fast static pages                               | Learning curve for Astro specifically  |
| SEO-perfect out of the box                              |                                        |
| Content & code cleanly separated                        |                                        |

### Option D: SvelteKit

```
SvelteKit → Svelte components for visualizations
File-based routing, SSR/SSG
```

| ✅ Pros                                                 | ❌ Cons                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Incredibly lightweight output                           | Smaller ecosystem than React            |
| Animations/transitions are first-class                  | Fewer pre-built visualization libraries |
| Reactive by default = perfect for parameter playgrounds | Team familiarity might be lower         |
| Very clean component syntax                             |                                         |

### Option E: Vanilla HTML/JS Pages (Progressive Enhancement)

```
Each module = standalone HTML page
Shared CSS framework + JS utility library
Canvas/WebGL for visualizations
```

| ✅ Pros                                     | ❌ Cons                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Maximum simplicity, zero framework overhead | No component reusability without effort |
| Each page is self-contained                 | State management is manual              |
| Easy for others to contribute               | Hard to maintain consistency at scale   |
| Fastest to prototype                        | No routing, nav is manual               |

### 🏆 Recommendation Discussion

- **If you want the Brilliant-like polish and plan to scale**: **Next.js (A)** or **Astro (C)**
- **If you want fast iteration and lightweight**: **Vite + React (B)**
- **If you want the best DX for animations**: **SvelteKit (D)**
- **If content is king and interactivity is embedded**: **Astro + MDX (C)** is uniquely strong

## 2. Content Structure & Curriculum Design

### The Big Question: How to organize 100+ topics across 6+ tiers?

### Structure Option A: Linear Roadmap (Brilliant-style)

```
Tier 0 → Tier 1 → Tier 2 → ... → Tier 5
 └ Module 1      └ Module 1
 └ Module 2      └ Module 2
 └ Module 3      └ Module 3
```

- Strict linear progression
- Each module unlocks the next
- Clear "you are here" indicator
- Like a book — chapter by chapter

### Structure Option B: Skill Tree (RPG-style)

```
              [Transformers]
                   ↑
        [RNNs] ←— [Deep Learning] —→ [CNNs]
                   ↑
    [Trees] ←— [ML Fundamentals] —→ [SVMs]
                   ↑
           [Math Foundations]
```

- Visual tree/graph showing prerequisites
- Multiple paths through the content
- Some topics can be explored in parallel
- Learner picks their adventure but prerequisites are enforced

### Structure Option C: Topic Clusters with Paths

```
┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐
│  🔢 Math     │  │  🤖 Core ML  │  │  🧠 Deep     │
│  Foundation  │→ │  Algorithms  │→ │  Learning    │
│              │  │              │  │              │
│ • Linear Alg │  │ • Regression │  │ • Neural Nets│
│ • Calculus   │  │ • Trees      │  │ • CNNs       │
│ • Probability│  │ • Clustering │  │ • Transformers│
│ • Statistics │  │ • Evaluation │  │ • Training   │
└──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘
                         ↓
              ┌──────────────────────┐
              │  Suggested Paths:    │
              │  🎯 Vision Track     │
              │  📝 NLP Track        │
              │  🎮 RL Track         │
              │  🎨 Generative Track │
              │  🔬 Research Track   │
              └──────────────────────┘
```

- Groups of related topics that can be explored in any order within a cluster
- Clusters have dependencies on other clusters
- "Tracks" are curated paths through the clusters for specific goals

### Structure Option D: Concept Map (Wikipedia-style)

```
Every concept is a node. Connections show relationships.
No enforced order. Pure exploration.
Hover over a node → see prerequisites.
```

- Maximum freedom
- Great for reference, bad for beginners
- Could work as a supplementary navigation, not primary

### 🏆 Recommendation Discussion

- **For beginners who need structure**: **Option A (Linear)** or **Option C (Clusters + Paths)**
- **For engagement & replayability**: **Option B (Skill Tree)** — gamers love this
- **For comprehensive coverage**: **Option C** gives both structure AND flexibility
- **Hybrid approach**: Use **Option C as the primary** structure, with an **Option B skill tree** as a visual map overlay

Phase 2: [Free Playground] → open-ended sandbox for the concept
Phase 3: [Challenge] → "Can you make the model converge?" type tasks
```

- Combines the structure of A with the freedom of B
- Each module has three phases
- Challenges test real understanding, not just recall

### Format Option D: "Visual Story" (3Blue1Brown-style)

## 8. The "Learner's Notes" Question

> You're building this while learning. How does that journey integrate into the platform?

### Approach A: Integrated Blog / Journal

- Separate "Journal" section on the platform
- Each entry tagged to the relevant module
- "Read the developer's notes on this topic" link in each lesson
- **Pros**: Authentic, adds personality, SEO content
- **Cons**: Mixes two different content types, might confuse navigation

### Approach B: Margin Notes / Annotations

- Small "💡 Author's Note" callouts within lessons
- Collapsible, non-intrusive
- Personal insights, "what clicked for me" moments
- **Pros**: Integrated naturally, adds depth without clutter
- **Cons**: Limited space, can't be long-form

### Approach C: Keep Journal External (TG Channel)

- Platform is purely the learning tool
- Telegram channel / blog is the build log
- Cross-link: "Follow the build journey on Telegram"
- **Pros**: Clean separation of concerns, TG community stays active
- **Cons**: Can't leverage the content for SEO, disconnected experiences

### Approach D: "Behind the Scene" Toggle

- Each module has a toggle: "📖 See how this was built"
- Opens a side panel or overlay with the learning journey for that topic
- What resources were used, what was confusing, breakthrough moments
- **Pros**: Opt-in, doesn't clutter main experience, meta-learning
- **Cons**: Extra content to maintain

### 🏆 Recommendation Discussion

- **Approach B** (Margin Notes) for V1 — easiest to implement, highest value
- **Approach C** (External TG) is already set up and working
- Later, add **Approach D** as a premium/unique feature
- Avoid **Approach A** for now — it's a separate product within a product

- Free tier covers a lot
- No GPU access (can't run models server-side)

### Backend Option B: Python Backend (FastAPI on Render)

```
Frontend: Vercel
Backend: FastAPI on Render
DB: PostgreSQL on Render
ML: CPU inference with PyTorch/sklearn
```

- Can run ML models server-side
- Python ecosystem for AI
- Render free tier is decent
- Limited compute for heavy models

```
Frontend: Vercel/Netlify (static)
Auth + DB: Firebase
Real-time: Firestore
Functions: Firebase Cloud Functions (for light compute)
```

- Google ecosystem
- Real-time sync out of the box
- Generous free tier
- Not ideal for ML compute

### Backend Option D: Supabase All-in-One

```
Frontend: Vercel
Everything else: Supabase
  - Auth, DB, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime
```

- Open-source Firebase alternative
- PostgreSQL under the hood
- Excellent free tier
- Growing ecosystem

### For ML Model Inference (Advanced Features)

- **TensorFlow.js / ONNX.js**: Run models in the browser (no backend needed!)
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: Free GPU inference endpoints
- **Replicate**: Pay-per-use GPU inference
- **Modal**: Serverless GPU compute

### 🏆 Recommendation Discussion

- **V1 (No backend)**: Everything runs client-side. No auth, no progress saving. Just pure visualizations.
- **V1.5 (Local storage)**: Save progress in browser's localStorage. Still no backend.
- **V2 (Supabase)**: Add auth + progress sync when you need it. **Supabase (D)** is the simplest.
- **V3+ (Python backend)**: Add **FastAPI on Render (B)** only when you need server-side ML inference.

1. **Tech stack**: Which framework? (Next.js vs Vite vs Astro vs SvelteKit)
2. **Lesson format**: Brilliant-style guided steps (A) or playground pages (B) or hybrid (C)?
3. **Design direction**: Which aesthetic?
4. **Content structure**: Linear roadmap, skill tree, or cluster + paths?

### 🟡 Important (Decide During V1)

5. **Gamification level**: How much? (Minimum vs Light vs Full)
6. **Learner's notes**: Integrated or external?
7. **Primary visualization library**: Canvas/Konva, D3, or p5.js?
8. **Math rendering**: KaTeX or MathJax?
9. **Navigation pattern**: Sidebar, map, dashboard, or Netflix?

### 🟢 Can Decide Later

10. **Backend**: When to add? Which stack?
11. **Auth & progress**: When to add user accounts?
12. **Mobile**: Mobile-first or desktop-first? (Visualizations are tricky on mobile)
13. **Monetization**: Free forever? Freemium? Donations?
14. **Community features**: Comments, discussions, study groups?
15. **Contributing**: Open-source? Allow community-submitted modules?
16. **Naming & branding**: What's the final name?

#### Full Module Example

```
MODULE: "Gradient Descent"  (~15-25 minutes)
│
├── PHASE 1: GUIDED EXPLORATION  (10-15 screens)
│   │
│   │  Screen 1: [Visual: 3D loss surface]
│   │            "Imagine you're standing on a mountain in fog.
│   │             You can feel the slope under your feet but can't
│   │             see the bottom. How do you get down?"
│   │            (no question — just observe + internalize)
│   │
│   │  Screen 2: [Visual: ball on surface + gradient arrow]
│   │            "The gradient tells you which way is uphill.
│   │             To minimize loss, we go the opposite direction."
│   │            ○ Uphill   ○ Downhill   ○ Sideways   ← quiz
│   │
│   │            ▸ Go Deeper
│   │              "The gradient ∇L(θ) is the vector of partial
│   │               derivatives [∂L/∂θ₁, ∂L/∂θ₂, ...]. It points
│   │               in the direction of steepest ascent. We step
│   │               in -∇L(θ) to descend."
│   │
│   │  Screen 3: [Visual: ball takes one step, loss value updates]
│   │            "One step downhill → loss decreased!"
│   │            💡 Author's Note: "This is where it clicked —
│   │               gradient descent is literally just 'go downhill'"
│   │
│   │            ▸ Go Deeper
│   │              "Update rule: θ_{t+1} = θ_t - α∇L(θ_t)
│   │               where α is the learning rate. This is the
│   │               simplest form — vanilla gradient descent.
│   │               See: Cauchy (1847), method of steepest descent."
│   │
│   │  Screen 4: [Visual: learning rate slider appears]
│   │            "Drag the slider. What happens with a very large step?"
│   │            [Interactive — user drags, sees overshooting]
│   │
│   │            ▸ Go Deeper
│   │              "When α is too large, the update overshoots the
│   │               minimum and can diverge. Convergence requires
│   │               α < 2/L where L is the Lipschitz constant of
│   │               the gradient. In practice, this is why we use
│   │               learning rate schedules."
│   │
│   │  ... more screens: convergence, local minima, saddle points
│   │
│   └── Screen N: Summary card + "Ready for the playground?"
│
├── PHASE 2: FREE PLAYGROUND
│   │
│   │  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   │  │  Full interactive visualization             │
│   │  │  All parameters exposed (lr, momentum,     │
│   │  │  loss function, data noise, etc.)           │
│   │  │  "Try This" prompts on the side             │
│   │  │  No sequence — explore freely               │
│   │  └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
│   │
│   └── 💡 Guided "Try This" prompts (optional):
│       • "Can you find the learning rate where it diverges?"
│       • "Switch to Adam. How does it differ on this landscape?"
│       • "Add noise to the data. Does GD still converge?"
│
└── PHASE 3: CHALLENGE  (2-4 tasks)
    │
    │  Challenge 1: "Configure the optimizer to converge in <20 steps"
    │               [Visual: loss surface + step counter]
    │               ✅ Completed when loss < 0.01 in ≤20 steps
    │
    │  Challenge 2: "The model is stuck in a local minimum.
    │                Adjust parameters to escape it."
    │               ✅ Completed when global minimum reached
    │
    └── Challenge 3: "Match the target loss curve"
                     [Visual: target curve overlaid, your curve updates live]
                     ✅ Completed when curves overlap within threshold
```

**Why this format works:**

- **Visualization-first** = every concept is _seen_ before it's read
- **Intuitive top-layer** = beginners never feel lost, plain language always present
- **"Go Deeper" expandable** = experienced learners get formal rigor, math, and paper refs on-demand
- **Phase 1** = everyone understands (guided, can't get lost)
- **Phase 2** = deep learners explore (sandbox for curiosity)
- **Phase 3** = proves understanding (active recall, not passive viewing)
- You can skip Phase 2 & 3 if you just want the explanation and move on
- Both audiences are served **on the same page** — no mode switch, no separate tracks

## 15. Scalability Strategy

> The platform currently has **82 modules** across 6 tiers. AI is the fastest-moving field in tech — this number will grow. This section outlines how the architecture, content system, and UI will scale from tens to hundreds to potentially thousands of modules without breaking.

---

### Growth Projections

```
Phase 1 — V1 Launch:       ~30 modules  (Tier 0 + 1 + partial 2)
Phase 2 — Full Curriculum:  ~82 modules  (all 6 tiers complete)
Phase 3 — Expanded:        ~150 modules  (sub-topics, new research areas)
Phase 4 — Comprehensive:   ~300 modules  (specialization tracks, applied ML)
Phase 5 — Community:       ~500+ modules (contributor-submitted content)
```

Each phase introduces new scaling challenges. Below is the strategy for each layer of the system.

---

### 🏧 1. Architecture — Module-as-Package Pattern

The most critical decision: **every module is a self-contained, self-registering folder**. Adding a module = adding a folder. Zero changes to core engine code.

#### Module folder structure:

```
content/
├── tier0/
│   ├── vectors/
│   │   ├── config.ts          # Metadata, tags, prerequisites, difficulty
│   │   ├── steps.ts           # Guided exploration step definitions
│   │   ├── playground.ts      # Playground configuration & "Try This" prompts
│   │   ├── challenges.ts      # Challenge task definitions
│   │   └── deeper.ts          # "Go Deeper" content per step (formal math, refs)
│   ├── norms/
│   │   ├── config.ts
│   │   ├── steps.ts
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...               # Each new module = new folder, nothing else changes
├── tier1/
└── ...
```

#### Module config schema:

```ts
// content/tier0/vectors/config.ts
export const moduleConfig = {
  id: "vectors",
  title: "Vectors & Matrices",
  tier: 0,
  cluster: "linear-algebra", // ← for sub-grouping within tiers
  tags: ["linear-algebra", "geometry", "foundation"],
  prerequisites: [], // module IDs that must be completed first
  difficulty: "beginner", // beginner | intermediate | advanced | research
  estimatedMinutes: 20,
  version: "1.0",
  lastUpdated: "2026-03-01",
  author: "platform", // "platform" | contributor username
  status: "published", // draft | review | published | archived
  visualizationComponent: "VectorTransform", // maps to component in visualizations/
};
```

#### Content registry (auto-discovery):

```ts
// lib/contentRegistry.ts
// At build time, Next.js scans all content/ folders and generates the registry
// No manual imports — add a folder and it appears in the curriculum

export function getAllModules(): Module[] { ... }
export function getModulesByTier(tier: number): Module[] { ... }
export function getModulesByCluster(cluster: string): Module[] { ... }
export function getModulesByTag(tag: string): Module[] { ... }
export function getPrerequisiteGraph(): Graph { ... }
```

This means at **any scale**, adding a new module is:

1. Create a folder
2. Fill in `config.ts`, `steps.ts`, `challenges.ts`
3. Build the visualization component
4. Done — module appears automatically

---

### 🗂 2. Content Organization — Sub-Clusters Within Tiers

Flat lists break down past ~15 items. As tiers grow, modules group into **named clusters**:

#### Current (V1): Flat list within tiers

```
Tier 3: Deep Learning  [17 modules]
├── Perceptron
├── Multi-Layer Networks
├── Activation Functions
├── Weight Initialization
├── Backpropagation
├── ... (17 items in a flat list)
```

#### Scaled (V2+): Clustered within tiers

```
Tier 3: Deep Learning  [17 modules, 4 clusters]
│
├── 🧱 Foundations                        [5 modules]
│   ├── Perceptron
│   ├── Multi-Layer Networks
│   ├── Activation Functions
│   ├── Weight Initialization
│   └── Backpropagation
│
├── ⚙️ Training Techniques                 [5 modules]
│   ├── Optimization Algorithms
│   ├── Learning Rate Schedules
│   ├── Batch Normalization
│   ├── Dropout
│   └── Data Augmentation
│
├── 🖼 Vision                              [4 modules]
│   ├── CNNs
│   ├── Pooling & Stride
│   ├── Residual Connections
│   └── CNN Architectures
│
└── 📝 Sequences                            [3 modules]
    ├── RNNs
    ├── LSTM/GRU
    └── Sequence-to-Sequence
```

**UI treatment**: Tier overview page shows cluster cards (collapsed). Click a cluster → see its modules. The tier card on the dashboard still shows "17 modules • 40% complete" without overwhelming the user.

**When to introduce clusters**: When any tier exceeds **~12 modules**, start clustering. Below that, flat list is fine.

---

### 🏷 3. Tagging & Filtering System

As modules grow, users need multiple ways to find content beyond just browsing tiers:

#### Tag taxonomy:

```
Domain Tags:          linear-algebra, calculus, probability, statistics,
                      optimization, supervised, unsupervised, vision,
                      nlp, reinforcement-learning, generative, research

Difficulty Tags:      beginner, intermediate, advanced, research-level

Concept Tags:         gradient, loss-function, attention, convolution,
                      embedding, regularization, normalization

Application Tags:     image-classification, text-generation, anomaly-detection,
                      recommendation, time-series, robotics
```

#### What tagging enables:

| Feature                     | How Tags Power It                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Search bar**              | Fuzzy search over title + tags + description        |
| **"Related modules"**       | Show modules that share 2+ tags with current module |
| **"If you liked X"**        | Recommend modules from same domain                  |
| **Filter by topic**         | Dashboard filters: "Show only NLP modules"          |
| **Track generation**        | Track = ordered list of modules matching a tag set  |
| **Prerequisite validation** | Tags help infer implicit prerequisites              |

#### Implementation (client-side, V2):

```ts
// Fuse.js for fuzzy client-side search
import Fuse from "fuse.js";

const fuse = new Fuse(allModules, {
  keys: ["title", "tags", "description", "cluster"],
  threshold: 0.3,
});

const results = fuse.search("attention mechanism");
```

---

### 🛤 4. Dynamic Tracks & Specialization Paths

Currently tracks are static (listed in Section 14). At scale, tracks should be **data-driven**:

```ts
// content/tracks/cv-engineer.ts
export const track = {
  id: "cv-engineer",
  title: "Computer Vision Engineer",
  icon: "🎯",
  description: "From linear algebra to diffusion models",
  modules: [
    "tier0/vectors",
    "tier0/matrices",
    "tier0/linear-transforms",
    "tier1/gradient-descent",
    "tier3/cnns",
    "tier3/residual-connections",
    "tier3/cnn-architectures",
    "tier4/vision-transformers",
    "tier4/diffusion-models",
  ],
  estimatedHours: 25,
  difficulty: "intermediate",
};
```

#### Future track types:

| Track Type           | Description                                             | When to Add          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Career tracks**    | Vision Engineer, NLP Engineer, RL Specialist            | V2 (150+ modules)    |
| **Project tracks**   | "Build a Chatbot", "Build an Image Classifier"          | V3 (applied content) |
| **Sprint tracks**    | "Weekend Deep Dive: Transformers" (5-6 focused modules) | V2                   |
| **Community tracks** | User-curated module sequences                           | V4 (with auth)       |

---

### 🔧 5. Content Authoring Pipeline

At 300+ modules, individual handcrafting doesn't scale. A structured authoring pipeline:

#### CLI scaffolding tool:

```bash
# Generate a new module with all required files
npm run new-module -- --tier 3 --id batch-normalization --cluster training

# Output:
# ✓ Created content/tier3/batch-normalization/config.ts
# ✓ Created content/tier3/batch-normalization/steps.ts      (template)
# ✓ Created content/tier3/batch-normalization/playground.ts  (template)
# ✓ Created content/tier3/batch-normalization/challenges.ts  (template)
# ✓ Created content/tier3/batch-normalization/deeper.ts      (template)
# ✓ Created visualizations/tier3/BatchNormalization.tsx       (template)
# ✓ Module registered in curriculum
```

#### Content quality checklist (per module):

```
☐ config.ts complete (metadata, tags, prerequisites, difficulty)
☐ Minimum 8 guided steps
☐ Each step has a visualization component
☐ Each step has intuitive explanation (2-3 sentences)
☐ At least 50% of steps have "Go Deeper" content
☐ At least 3 quiz questions across guided phase
☐ Playground has 3+ "Try This" prompts
☐ 2-4 challenges with measurable completion criteria
☐ At least 1 Author's Note
☐ Visualization renders correctly at all breakpoints
☐ Estimated time is accurate (±5 minutes)
```

#### Contributor flow (future, V4+):

```
Contributor forks repo
    → Uses CLI to scaffold module
    → Fills in content following template
    → Submits PR
    → Automated checks: config valid, steps complete, viz renders
    → Content review by maintainer
    → Merge → auto-deploys via Vercel
```

---

### 📊 6. Tier & Level Scaling Strategy

As content grows, the tier system itself needs to scale:

#### Phase 1 (V1): 6 fixed tiers

```
Tier 0 → Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3 → Tier 4 → Tier 5
(Math)   (ML)     (Classical) (Deep)  (Modern) (Research)
```

#### Phase 2 (~150 modules): Sub-tiers emerge

```
Tier 3: Deep Learning
  ├── 3A: DL Foundations
  ├── 3B: Training Deep
  ├── 3C: Convolutional Networks
  └── 3D: Sequential Models
```

#### Phase 3 (~300 modules): Horizontal expansion

New tiers for applied/specialized content:

```
Core Path (existing):
  Tier 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5

Specialization Branches (new):
  Tier 3 ─┬─ Applied CV           [12 modules]
         ├─ Applied NLP          [15 modules]
         ├─ Applied RL           [10 modules]
         ├─ MLOps & Deployment   [8 modules]
         └─ Data Engineering     [6 modules]

  Tier 5 ─┬─ Neuro-Symbolic AI    [5 modules]
         ├─ Embodied AI          [6 modules]
         └─ AI for Science       [8 modules]
```

#### Phase 4 (~500+ modules): Community-driven expansion

```
Official Content:    Maintained by platform team, quality-assured
Community Content:   Contributor-submitted, marked with contributor badge
Featured Collections: Curated "best of" collections
```

The UI adapts at each phase:

| Scale            | Dashboard UI                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **30 modules**   | Flat tier cards with progress bars                           |
| **80 modules**   | Tier cards with cluster indicators                           |
| **150 modules**  | Tier cards expand into cluster views + search bar            |
| **300 modules**  | Tab groups (Core / Specializations / Applied) + filters      |
| **500+ modules** | Full directory with search, filters, tracks, recommendations |

---

### 🔄 7. Versioning & Content Lifecycle

AI research makes content obsolete fast. A versioning strategy for longevity:

#### Module lifecycle states:

### 🧮 8. Scaling Summary Matrix

| Scale       | Modules | Key Changes Needed                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **V1**      | ~30     | Flat tier lists, no search needed, no clustering                                      |
| **Full V1** | ~82     | Sub-clusters for large tiers (Tier 3, 4), basic search                                |
| **V2**      | ~150    | Tagging system, Fuse.js search, career tracks, sub-tiers                              |
| **V3**      | ~300    | Applied/specialization branches, content authoring CLI, version badges                |
| **V4**      | ~500+   | Contributor pipeline, community tracks, recommendations, content lifecycle management |

**The key principle**: Build the **module-as-package** pattern and **content registry** in V1. Everything else (clusters, search, tracks, contributor pipeline) layers on top without architectural changes. The V1 architecture must assume it will hold 500 modules even if it launches with 30.
